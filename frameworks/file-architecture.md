# File Architecture for the Knowledge Ecosystem

This document defines where Markdown, YAML, and JSON files belong within the knowledge ecosystem repository. It provides a clear, stable reference for future sprints as the system evolves from human‑first reflection to structured governance and eventually to machine‑readable analytics.

## 1. Overview

The repository uses three complementary file formats, each serving a distinct purpose:

Markdown (MD): Human‑readable thinking surfaces

YAML: Structured governance and metadata

JSON: Machine‑readable analytics and telemetry

Together, they form a layered architecture that supports Takt‑aligned development across multiple sprints.

## 2. Markdown Layer — Human‑First Thinking

Markdown files are used for:

Conceptual frameworks

Pages and evolving ideas

Sprint logs and reflections

Teaching and consulting artefacts

Narrative explanations and identity‑aligned documents

Location

/frameworks/*.md

/pages/*.md

/sprints/*.md

/templates/*.md

Examples

knowledge-ecosystem-architecture.md

takt-based-sprint-model.md

sprint-01-telemetry.md

boundary-governance-checklist.md

Markdown is the thinking and reflection layer.

## 3. YAML Layer — Governance and Structure

YAML files provide structured, human‑readable metadata for:

Sprint definitions

Telemetry schemas

Governance rules

Configuration for future automation

Location

/sprints/*.yaml

/frameworks/*.yaml

/templates/*.yaml

Examples (future sprints)

sprint-01.yaml

telemetry-schema.yaml

boundary-governance.yaml

YAML is the governance and configuration layer.

## 4. JSON Layer — Analytics and Machine‑Readable Data

JSON files are used for:

Exported telemetry

Historical lift/drag data

Takt adherence metrics

Dashboards and analytics pipelines

Location

/sprints/data/*.json

/analytics/*.json

Examples (future sprints)

sprint-01-telemetry.json

lift-drag-history.json

takt-adherence.json

JSON is the analytics and automation layer.

## 5. Evolution Across Sprints

The ecosystem evolves through three levels:

Level 1 — Markdown‑only (Sprint 01–02)

Human‑first reflection

Manual telemetry capture

Low friction, high clarity

Level 2 — YAML schemas (Sprint 03–04)

Structured sprint definitions

Governance as data

Early automation

Level 3 — JSON analytics (Sprint 05+)

Machine‑readable telemetry

Dashboards and trend analysis

Automated insights

This staged evolution ensures sustainable Takt and avoids premature complexity.

This architecture provides a clear, scalable structure for the knowledge ecosystem as it matures across multiple sprints, balancing human clarity with future automation.
