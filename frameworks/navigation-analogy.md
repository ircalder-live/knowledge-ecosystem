# Navigation Analogy for Governance and GitHub Issues

This page provides a conceptual scaffold for understanding how GitHub Issues function as navigation instruments within a governance‑grade knowledge ecosystem. It connects classical project‑management principles with operational rhythm, Takt, telemetry, and the governance flywheel.

## 1. The Vessel: The Knowledge Ecosystem
The repository represents the vessel—a governed, evolving system that must be navigated toward strategic outcomes. It contains:
* Frameworks (stable systems)
* Pages (draft ideas)
* Sprints (operational cycles)
* Templates (repeatable structures)
* Telemetry (instrumentation)

The vessel moves through time and uncertainty, requiring both mathematical precision and informed judgement.

## 2. The Captain: Strategy, Judgement, and Command
The project manager or architect acts as the captain. Responsibilities include:
* Setting direction (strategy)
* Defining scope (what must be done)
* Establishing cadence (Takt)
* Issuing operational orders (bursts)
* Monitoring conditions (lift and drag)
* Adjusting course (governance)

The captain’s decisions are recorded, measured, and refined through the sprint cycle.

## 3. The Chart: Scope, Schedule, and Effort
Every voyage requires a chart. In this ecosystem, the chart is defined by:
* Scope: Sprint backlog and artefacts
* Schedule: Sprint window and cadence
* Effort: Bursts, durations, and reflections

These elements form the mathematical basis for navigation.

## 4. The Logbook: GitHub Issues as Operational Records
GitHub Issues serve as the bridge logbook. They capture:
* Declared Takt (speed orders)
* Backlog items (waypoints)
* Bursts (engine performance)
* Lift and drag (conditions)
* Reflections (crew insights)
* Definition of Done (arrival criteria)

Issues are not “bugs.” They are structured, timestamped records of work.

## 5. The Engine Room: Execution and Bursts
Bursts represent the engine room’s output. They are:
* Time‑boxed work intervals
* Sources of telemetry
* Evidence of operational rhythm

The captain sets the Takt; the engine room executes.

## 6. The Instruments: Telemetry and Measurement
Telemetry provides the instrumentation needed for navigation. It includes:
* Lift (clarity, momentum)
* Drag (friction, noise)
* Boundary governance adherence
* Emotional/cognitive load
* Burst frequency and duration

Telemetry transforms subjective experience into measurable data.

## 7. The Forecast: Analytics and Insight Generation
Over multiple sprints, Issues generate a dataset that supports:
* Velocity analysis
* Takt sustainability
* Lift/drag trends
* Boundary governance effectiveness
* Forecasting and planning

This is where YAML schemas and JSON exports will later integrate.

## 8. The Governance Flywheel
The navigation cycle forms a governance flywheel:
* Strategy → Set direction
* Scoping → Define work
* Scheduling → Establish cadence
* Executing → Perform bursts
* Data Generation → Capture telemetry
* Insight Generation → Analyse patterns
* Governance → Adjust course

Each sprint strengthens the vessel and improves future navigation.
