# Operating Model
This document defines the governing logic of the knowledge ecosystem: how work flows, how value is released, and how the system maintains stability as it grows. It establishes the principles, constraints, and rhythms that enable sustainable execution across sprints, ensuring that research, ingestion, and architectural evolution remain coherent over time.

The operating model is not a process checklist. It is the structural backbone of the ecosystem — the way the project thinks, moves, and scales. It integrates Takt, constraints, batch governance, and release discipline into a single, intentional flow that protects quality, preserves cadence, and supports long‑term agility.

## Purpose
To articulate a clear, durable framework for how the ecosystem operates week‑to‑week, sprint‑to‑sprint, and domain‑to‑domain. This model ensures that:
* cadence remains constant
* research is protected as the bottleneck
* ingestion is predictable and governed
* batches act as buffers
* architectural integrity is maintained
* contributor readiness improves over time
* the corpus grows sustainably and ethically

This operating model is the foundation for scaling the glossary, supporting teaching and consulting, and preparing for future contributors and publication.

## Core Principles
* **Takt**: A fixed weekly cadence that governs release rhythm.
* **Constraints**: Research is the designed bottleneck; the system protects it.
* **Flow**: Ingestion volume varies, but cadence does not.
* **Batches**: Work packages that buffer the bottleneck and regulate flow.
* **Governance**: Gate‑based validation ensures quality and architectural stability.
* **Agility**: Domains evolve across multiple sprints; the system adapts as knowledge expands.

The sections below translate these principles into the concrete weekly rhythm, flow structure, and governance mechanisms that guide execution.

## Weekly Cadence, Constraints, and Flow Governance
### 1. Sprint Cadence
Duration: 1 week
Start: 0000 Monday (NZ time)
End: 2359 Sunday
Review & Retrospective: Sunday evening
Next Sprint: Begins immediately at 0000 Monday

This cadence is fixed and does not change, regardless of workload or ingestion volume.

### 2. Flow Structure
The weekly rhythm is:

#### Days 1–5 (Mon–Fri): Research & Design
* Domain research
* Source gathering and validation
* Term selection and scoping
* Drafting definitions
* Drafting first‑pass Chinese equivalents
* Batch file construction
* Documentation of research decisions

#### Days 6–7 (Sat–Sun): Validation & Ingestion
* Gate 1–4 validation
* Refinement of definitions and equivalents
* Finalization of the batch file
* Ingestion into the ecosystem
* Commit + push
* Sprint review and retrospective

This mirrors the successful pattern of Sprint 01 and Burst 28.

### 3. Constraint Management (Theory of Constraints)
The bottleneck is research — by design.  
Research determines how many terms are ready each sprint.  
The bottleneck sets the pace of the entire system.  
We never starve the bottleneck.  
We never overload the bottleneck.

#### Implications
Ingestion volume varies; cadence does not.  
Even ingesting one term per sprint is healthy if research is progressing.  
Batch files evolve across multiple sprints.  
Research may span several sprints for large domains (e.g., Digital Ethics, RAI).  
This preserves flow, stability, and architectural integrity.

### 4. Batches as Buffers
A batch file is:
* a work package
* a risk container
* a flow regulator
* a buffer protecting the bottleneck

#### Batch Lifecycle
* Research
* Term selection
* Draft definitions
* Draft Chinese equivalents
* Batch file assembly
* Gate 1–4 validation
* Ingestion
* Commit + push
* Release tagging (optional)

Batch size is flexible, and batch cadence is fixed (weekly).

### 5. Ingestion Cadence
* Ingestion occurs every sprint, regardless of volume.
* Volume is determined by research readiness.
* Cadence is determined by the sprint rhythm.

This ensures:
* predictable flow
* stable architecture
* consistent progress
* no oscillation or backlog starvation

### 6. Multi‑Sprint Research
Large domains (Digital Ethics, Responsible AI) will require:
* multiple sprints of research
* iterative refinement
* evolving batch files
* partial ingestion each sprint

This is expected and healthy.

### 7. Governance Benefits
This operating model provides:
* stability
* predictability
* auditability
* contributor readiness
* architectural coherence
* psychological safety
* sustainable pace

It is the foundation for scaling the knowledge ecosystem.

### 8. Scope of This Operating Model
This operating model governs:
* weekly cadence and release rhythm  
* batch lifecycle and ingestion discipline  
* research flow and constraint management  
* cross‑sprint evolution of domains  
* contributor‑readiness practices  

It does not prescribe:
* specific research methods  
* domain‑specific term lists  
* teaching content or curriculum  
* automation implementation details  

These are governed by separate framework documents.

Together, these principles form the stable, ethical, and sustainable foundation on which the knowledge ecosystem grows.
