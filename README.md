# Knowledge Ecosystem

This is a governance‑grade, Takt‑aligned knowledge system designed to support sustainable professional practice, structured reflection, telemetry‑driven insight generation, and long‑horizon strategic development.

This repository serves as the canonical source of truth for:
- Frameworks and conceptual models  
- Draft and stable Pages  
- Sprint operations and governance  
- Templates for repeatable workflows  
- Telemetry, analytics, and future automation  

The system evolves through disciplined cadence (Takt), boundary governance, and evidence‑based iteration.

## Versioning and Evolution

The ecosystem evolves through three levels:

### **Level 1 — Markdown-first (Sprint 01–02)**
Human‑readable thinking surfaces, manual telemetry, low friction.

### **Level 2 — YAML schemas (Sprint 03–04)**
Governance as data, structured metadata, early automation.

### **Level 3 — JSON analytics (Sprint 05+)**
Machine‑readable telemetry, dashboards, forecasting, and insight generation.

Each sprint contributes to the governance flywheel:
**strategy → scoping → scheduling → executing → data generation → insight → governance**.

## Governance Principles

- **The repository is the source of truth.**  
- **Cadence (Takt) drives execution.**  
- **Issues serve as operational logbook entries.**  
- **Telemetry informs lift, drag, and course correction.**  
- **Frameworks emerge from validated practice.**
