# Sprint 02 Retrospective
Date Range: Monday 12 January 2026 – Sunday 18 January 2026
Cadence: 1‑week sprint (aligned with Operating Model)
Sub-issues Completed: 14
Status: DONE

## 1. Sprint Theme
**Activation and Operationalization.**  
Sprint 02 shifts the ecosystem from architectural design to lived practice. The focus is on standing up the Lab, operationalizing research workflows, and launching the Digital Ethics domain project.

## 2. Sprint Goals  
### 🎯 Primary Goals  
- Stand up the **Research Lab** structure (templates, logs, reproducibility patterns).  
- Launch the **Digital Ethics Domain Project** as the first domain‑level initiative.  
- Establish **experiment logging** and **artifact templates** for research workflows.  
- Begin **operationalizing the Research Operating Model** drafted in Sprint 01.  
- Ensure documentation hygiene remains consistent across new artifacts.

### 🔧 Secondary Goals  
- Review and refine GitHub labels to support research workflows.  
- Initialize sprint‑level measurements and baselines.  
- Prepare contributor‑ready documentation for future collaborators.

## 3. Summary of Achievements
* Completion of first domain artifact
* Successful execution of the first experiment  
* Controlled prompting workflow  
* Glossary batch expansion  
* Governance checkpoint confirmation  
* Decision to defer glossary integration  
* Closure of superseded sub‑issues (#10 and #11)  
* Confirmation that Sprint 02 achieved 100% completion

## Lessons Learned
* Discovery of natural slack and resilience  
* Insight that backlog buffer can expand proportionally  
* Recognition that timestamps now form a time‑series dataset  
* Confirmation that dependency‑driven sequencing worked  
* Validation of minimal scaffolding for heterogeneous domains  
* Identification of natural bundling as a governance principle  
* Awareness of scope‑creep boundaries and task‑switching drag  
* Confirmation that backlog hygiene (closing #10 and #11) is essential

## Cross-Sprint Knowledge  
* Flexibility is a structural requirement, not a preference  
* Minimal scaffolding is the correct approach for early domain formation  
* Controlled prompting is a repeatable technique  
* Experiment logs and hygiene are foundational for MLops readiness  
* Governance checkpoints prevent drift and ensure contributor‑readiness. Governance checks can be at any state or time.

</table>

Sprint 02 delivered a deeper and more research‑intensive body of work than Sprint 01, and the measurements reflect that shift from initialization to activation.

Artifacts created: 1 major artifact delivered (Digital Ethics), plus multiple experiment‑related outputs (analysis, logs, controlled prompting batch)

Templates created: 1 experiment log template implicitly established through EXP‑001 documentation

Experiment logs completed: 2 full logs produced for EXP‑001, meeting reproducibility and hygiene standards

Documentation hygiene checks: Multiple cycles across experiment logs, domain scaffolds, APA citation integration, and retrospective materials

Domain project scaffolds: 2 minimal, flexible scaffolds created (aiml/ and digital-ethics/)

Issues closed: 8 issues closed, including superseded sub‑issues (#10 and #11), demonstrating backlog hygiene and governance alignment

**Measurement Summary**:  
Sprint 02 exceeded expectations in research‑grade outputs, domain activation, and documentation quality. The telemetry now includes experiment counts, domain scaffolding, and governance signals, forming the baseline for future quantitative governance.

## 4. What Went Well
Dependency‑driven sequencing worked flawlessly. Foundational sub‑issues were completed first, enabling downstream work without friction.

Experimentation reached research‑grade quality. EXP‑001 produced reproducible logs, structured artifacts, and meaningful analysis.

Controlled prompting proved effective. Glossary Batch Expansion validated the end‑to‑end workflow and produced useful candidate terms.

Domain scaffolding was executed with discipline. Minimal, flexible structures were created for AIML and Digital Ethics, avoiding premature taxonomy.

Digital Ethics artifact delivered immediate value. The AI‑assisted academic integrity note met a real academic need and established a strong domain anchor.

Backlog hygiene was proactive and principled. Superseded sub‑issues (#10 and #11) were closed, keeping the board truthful and aligned with reality.

Governance rhythm strengthened. Issue transitions, commit discipline, and review checkpoints reinforced operational maturity.

Natural bundling reduced cognitive drag. Related tasks were grouped and executed together, improving flow and reducing context switching.

## 5. What Could Be Improved
Earlier identification of uncertainty blockers. The delay around directory structure decisions highlighted the need for earlier detection of conceptual ambiguity.

More explicit slack management. Lost days did not harm the sprint, but future sprints would benefit from intentional slack planning and monitoring.

Clearer boundaries for glossary integration. The decision to defer integration was correct, but earlier recognition would have reduced mid‑sprint cognitive load.

Faster transition from insight to artifact. Some conceptual clarity emerged before it was captured; future sprints should convert insights into artifacts more quickly.

More deliberate use of telemetry. Now that time‑series data exists, future sprints can begin quantifying cycle time, lead time, and slack.

## 6. Changes for Sprint 03
Introduce initial quantitative governance. Begin analyzing timestamps, cycle times, and slack to establish baseline metrics.

Formalize natural bundling as a governance principle. Use it to structure Sprint 03 sub‑issues and reduce task switching.

Expand telemetry categories. Add glossary growth, ingestion volume, experiment count, and domain artifact count.

Strengthen domain‑specific workflows. AIML and Digital Ethics will now diverge; Sprint 03 should support their independent evolution.

Prepare for glossary integration. Candidate terms from Sprint 02 will be validated and prepared for production in a future sprint.

Refine backlog hygiene practices. Continue pruning superseded or low‑value sub‑issues early in the sprint.

## 7. Strategic Position at Sprint Close
Sprint 02 closes with the ecosystem in a significantly stronger strategic position:

The research pipeline is now real. Experiments, logs, analysis, and governance checkpoints are functioning as intended.

Domains are active and flexible. AIML and Digital Ethics have begun to diverge naturally, validating the minimal‑scaffold approach.

The glossary pipeline is primed. Controlled prompting produced high‑quality candidate terms ready for future integration.

Governance maturity increased. Backlog hygiene, dependency sequencing, and disciplined commits reinforced operational integrity.

Quantitative governance is now possible. Time‑series data from issues and commits enables future measurement and forecasting.

The ecosystem is contributor‑ready. Documentation hygiene, reproducibility, and domain clarity make the system scalable.

Sprint 02 delivered activation and operationalization exactly as intended.

Sprint 03 will build on this foundation by introducing quantitative governance and deepening domain‑specific workflows.

## 8. Sprint 01 Definition of Done

## Baseline Velocity  
Baseline Velocity (Across Sprints 01–02)
To establish a baseline, we average the sprint velocities:

Baseline Velocity
= (1 + 8) / 2 = 4.5
 issues per sprint
Rounded for planning purposes:

**Baseline velocity = 4–5 issues per sprint**

This is the initial planning velocity for Sprint 03.

## Baseline Metrics Established at Sprint 02 Close
Sprint 02 provided the first opportunity to establish quantitative baselines for future governance. These baselines reflect actual throughput, structural activation, and the emergence of reproducible workflows.  

### Velocity Baseline
Sprint 01 velocity: 1 issue
Sprint 02 velocity: 8 issues
Baseline velocity (mean): 4–5 issues per sprint

This becomes the initial planning velocity for Sprint 03.

## Experimentation Baseline
Experiments executed: 2
Experiment logs: 2 complete, reproducible logs
Experiment workflow: validated end‑to‑end (design → execution → logging → analysis → governance checkpoint)

## Domain Activation Baseline
Domains scaffolded: 2 (AIML, Digital Ethics)
Domain artifacts: 1 major artifact delivered (Digital Ethics)
Controlled prompting batches: 1 batch (Glossary Batch Expansion)

## Governance Baseline
Backlog hygiene actions: 2 superseded issues closed
Governance checkpoints: 1 formal checkpoint confirming experiment quality and domain readiness

Time‑series data: Issue transitions and commit timestamps now available for quantitative analysis

These baselines form the foundation for Sprint 03’s quantitative governance work.
