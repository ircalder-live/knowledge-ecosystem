# Sprint 02 — Initiation Document  
**Project:** Knowledge Ecosystem  
**Milestone:** Sprint 02  
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Owner:** Ian  
**Status:** Active

---

## 1. Sprint Theme  
**Activation and Operationalization.**  
Sprint 02 shifts the ecosystem from architectural design to lived practice. The focus is on standing up the Lab, operationalizing research workflows, and launching the Digital Ethics domain project.

---

## 2. Sprint Goals  
### 🎯 Primary Goals  
- Stand up the **Research Lab** structure (templates, logs, reproducibility patterns).  
- Launch the **Digital Ethics Domain Project** as the first domain‑level initiative.  
- Establish **experiment logging** and **artifact templates** for research workflows.  
- Begin **operationalizing the Research Operating Model** drafted in Sprint 01.  
- Ensure documentation hygiene remains consistent across new artifacts.

### 🔧 Secondary Goals  
- Review and refine GitHub labels to support research workflows.  
- Initialize sprint‑level measurements and baselines.  
- Prepare contributor‑ready documentation for future collaborators.

---

## 3. Scope  
### In Scope  
- Lab directory creation  
- Experiment log template  
- Research workflow template  
- Domain project structure for Digital Ethics  
- Label taxonomy update  
- Sprint metrics initialization  
- Issue creation and backlog grooming

### Out of Scope  
- Full implementation of Digital Ethics content  
- External contributor onboarding  
- Cross‑domain integration

---

## 4. Deliverables  
- `/lab/` directory with templates  
- `/domains/digital-ethics/` project scaffold  
- Updated GitHub labels  
- Sprint 02 GitHub issue  
- Initial metrics dashboard (manual or lightweight)

---

## 5. Risks & Mitigations  
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Over‑scoping the lab setup | Medium | Keep templates minimal and iterative |
| Documentation drift | High | Apply hygiene checks at each commit |
| Research workflow complexity | Medium | Start with a simple reproducible pattern |

---

## 6. Ceremonies  
- **Sprint Planning:** Completed via this kickoff  
- **Mid‑Sprint Review:** Check lab activation progress  
- **Sprint Review:** Demonstrate lab + domain project scaffolds  
- **Retrospective:** Evaluate operationalization and workflow clarity

---

## 7. Measurements (initialized for Sprint 02)  
- **Artifacts created:** 0 → target 6–10  
- **Templates created:** 0 → target 3  
- **Experiment logs started:** 0 → target 1–2  
- **Documentation hygiene checks:** 0 → target 4  
- **Domain project scaffolds:** 0 → target 1  
- **Issues closed:** 0 → target 8–12

---

## 8. Definition of Done  
- Lab directory exists with at least one working template  
- Digital Ethics domain project scaffolded  
- Labels updated and applied to Sprint 02 issues  
- All Sprint 02 tasks tracked in GitHub  
- Sprint Review and Retro completed
