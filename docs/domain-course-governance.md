# Domain & Course Bundle Governance
## Purpose
This document defines the governance principles for managing domain bundles and course bundles within the knowledge‑ecosystem.
It ensures clarity, ethical practice, and architectural consistency while keeping the workflow light and sustainable.

## Domains and courses share a dual identity:

Domains → semantic knowledge structures
Courses → pedagogical learning structures

This governance model ensures both identities remain coherent, aligned, and mutually reinforcing.

## 1. Governance Principles
* Maintain conceptual clarity between domains and courses
* Ensure shared artifacts serve both identities without duplication
* Keep governance lightweight to avoid unnecessary drag
* Preserve ethical sourcing and responsible authorship
* Support bilingual and cross‑cultural teaching
* Maintain transparency about methodology without over‑documenting

These principles guide all domain and course bundle development.

## 2. Domain Governance
Domains represent coherent clusters of related concepts.
They define the semantic architecture of the knowledge‑ecosystem.

### Responsibilities
* Define and maintain conceptual boundaries
* Ensure glossary entries follow the project schema
* Support multilingual terminology and cultural anchors
* Maintain cross‑domain consistency and linking

Keep domain definitions original, clear, and pedagogically useful

### Artifacts
* Multilingual glossary files (/i18n/en/*.yaml, /i18n/zh/*.yaml)
* Lookup index entries
* Domain overview pages (e.g., Digital Ethics Foundations)

Domains evolve as knowledge deepens and teaching needs expand.

## 3. Course Governance
Courses represent structured learning pathways built on top of domains.
They define the instructional flow and learning progression.

### Responsibilities
* Define learning objectives and teaching sequences
* Integrate cultural anchors and bilingual scaffolding
* Adapt domain knowledge for specific audiences
* Maintain clarity of instructional flow
* Ensure teaching pages remain accessible and pedagogically sound

### Artifacts
* Teaching pages (/pages/*.md)
* Course overview pages
* Learning paths
* Topic bundles

Courses evolve as teaching practice matures and new insights emerge.

## 4. Shared Artifacts
Domains and courses share several key artifacts:
* Glossary entries
* Teaching pages
* Topic overview pages
* Lookup indexes

These artifacts must be maintained in a way that supports both identities without duplication or conflict.

Shared artifacts are the connective tissue of the knowledge‑ecosystem.

## 5. Ethical Considerations
* Avoid reproducing copyrighted course materials
* Ensure all content is rewritten, synthesized, or contextualized
* Use AI prompting transparently and responsibly
* Respect cultural context in bilingual scaffolding
* Maintain clear separation between inspiration and reproduction
* Attribute only when quoting directly from published sources (rare)
* Ethics is a first‑class governance concern, not an afterthought.

## 6. Workflow Summary
* Identify domain concepts or course needs
* Draft glossary entries and teaching pages
* Add bilingual and cultural scaffolding
* Integrate into domain and course structures
* Update lookup indexes and topic bundles
* Review for clarity, ethics, and alignment with governance principles

This workflow keeps the system coherent, scalable, and contributor‑friendly.

## Conclusion
This governance model ensures that domain bundles and course bundles remain:
* coherent
* ethical
* scalable
* bilingual
* pedagogically rich
* architecturally aligned

It supports the creation of a multilingual knowledge‑ecosystem that grows sustainably and remains grounded in responsible practice.
